I want to build this because of Bryan. I saw his laptop video on LTT months ago; sitting in class bored out of my mind I thought how cool it would be if I had a class building a laptop.
More importantly, in this world I need to stand out. What I am particularly passionate about is PC hardware. Building this laptop seems to be an incredible challenge, one that is long but one that is rewarding. 
Bryan did the RK3588, I believe he did this to prove the point that an individual can make their own laptop. It is also cheaper than the OrinNX. I am doing the OrinNX because the RK3588 is already done. This will be harder because of the 10-12 layers needed for the PCB.
It will be faster however. We know faster is cooler. Therefore, even if it takes a year, it'll be worth it. And more importantly, it will be mine. Mine own piece of tech! How satisfying. 
I am a junior in computer engineering, I have minimal knowledge in coding if I am being honest, and even less for building something like this. I hope this to be done before I graduate in December 2026. Or, done at all.

It looks like theres no official NVIDIA dev kit for the Orin NX, just the nano and the agx. AGX is too big to fit into a nice slim laptop, nano.. not powerful enough. 
It seems to orin NX and nano are pin to pin compatible. 

Just spent $767 on the orin NX 16gb ($500 ebay purchase) and another $250 on the orin nano developer kit. last one in stock. lucky me!
ATNA40CU03-002 ATNA40CU03 14.0", took me awhile to find a screen that I want. 2880x1800 120hz oled 14" will do. Bryan's laptop is 13.3", so mine wont be quite as small. ($200)
Bought wired keyboard/mouse ($15), Orin NANO dev kit has SD card only as storage (15) USB sd card reader ($8), bought DP to eDP off aliexpress, includes 40 pin cable ($40).
