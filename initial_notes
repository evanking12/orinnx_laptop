I want to build this because of Bryan. I saw his laptop video on LTT months ago; sitting in class bored out of my mind I thought how cool it would be if I had a class building a laptop.
More importantly, in this world I need to stand out. What I am particularly passionate about is PC hardware. Building this laptop seems to be an incredible challenge, one that is long but one that is rewarding. 
Bryan did the RK3588, I believe he did this to prove the point that an individual can make their own laptop. It is also cheaper than the OrinNX. I am doing the OrinNX because the RK3588 is already done. This will be harder because of the 10-12 layers needed for the PCB.
It will be faster however. We know faster is cooler. Therefore, even if it takes a year, it'll be worth it. And more importantly, it will be mine. Mine own piece of tech! How satisfying. 
I am a junior in computer engineering, I have minimal knowledge in coding if I am being honest, and even less for building something like this. I hope this to be done before I graduate in December 2026. Or, done at all.

It looks like theres no official NVIDIA dev kit for the Orin NX, just the nano and the agx. AGX is too big to fit into a nice slim laptop, nano.. not powerful enough. 
It seems to orin NX and nano are pin to pin compatible. 

Just spent $767 on the orin NX 16gb ($500 ebay purchase) and another $250 on the orin nano developer kit. last one in stock. lucky me!
ATNA40CU03-002 ATNA40CU03 14.0", took me awhile to find a screen that I want. 2880x1800 120hz oled 14" will do. Bryan's laptop is 13.3", so mine wont be quite as small. ($200)
Bought wired keyboard/mouse ($15), Orin NANO dev kit has SD card only as storage (15) USB sd card reader ($8), bought DP to eDP off aliexpress, includes 40 pin cable ($40).

Going to make a road map of what I have to learn. 
Landed on just starting to understand KiCAD first. Since everything is currently be shipped and will take awhile; I can get a head start on designing the PCB. Going through all the getting started documents today. 

9/8/2025
Finished the KiCAD tutorial. Successfully going from "Where the hell do I start?" to "What the hell now?". But progress is progress. My next step is to successfully implement basic designs of a motherboard into KiCAD.
Understand more of PCB's in general. Not much else to do today. I believe this is my best bet while everything is in shipping.
Watching Rick Hartley's "How to achieve proper grounding". After this I will go through Dave Jones PCB Design tutorial. 
9/9/2025
Saving Rick's video until I can understand more about the terms being used, a lot was going over my head. Went through Dave Jones PCB design tutorial, today I will watch more Phil's Lab videos to turn online documents
into my PCB design software, I need to understand much more about schematics, footprints, and PCB still. Along with practicing good PCB design.

Feels like I didn't do much yesterday, Tried getting started on a schematic but still feels like a lot to put together, did watch a lot of Phil's Lab. Going to continue with that today. Need to just hammer in the basics of PCB's and KiCAD


9/12/25 
No work was done yesterday. Today will be finishing Phil's Lab STM32 basic walkthrough tutorial.
Change of plan. I think the best option is to get the SODIMM connector done and just ensure I know the process of doing that, get that onto a PCB, understand all there is to understand of it (in terms of PCB design) and branch out from there.
I believe that will be the hardest step. I need to get the ball rolling. 
9/14/25
Still watching more youtube videos; trying to understand more about overall PCB design like traces or crosstalk or varying layers of PCB's and where to put a signal and ground plane. A lot to learn but slowly chipping away.

9/28/25
Bought some courses to continue learning. Still have a lot to go to cover all my bases in an adequate manner. Been more consistent about learning, trying to actively learn about an hour a day now. 
9/29/25
Not sure how much I will update this throughout the learning process as there is not much to document. Like previously stated aiming for an hour a day of active learning, ideally more.
